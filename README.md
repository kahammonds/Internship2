Code and libraries to support Serial to PCAP

Okay here is what I have learned. 

The termios library is only used in Linux; however, when you attach it with termiWin, a termios porting for Windows is open and it should be able to be used. 

Ultimately, we were unable to use this Visual Studio because the repository was for Linux, not Windows!!!!!!!!

Plan of action: Download and run code on Ubuntu in order to utilize all of the Linux libraries. 
Alternate plan of action: Locate and use the C++ equivalent libraries and implement them in Visual Studio Code.
